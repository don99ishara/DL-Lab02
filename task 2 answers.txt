1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
With more hidden nodes, the model has more capacity to learn complex decision boundaries. Accuracy improves at first.


2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?  
Small hidden layers underfit (not enough capacity). Larger hidden layers fit better, but too many nodes can cause overfitting or unstable training. Accuracy improves up to a point, then may plateau or drop.
